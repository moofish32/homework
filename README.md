Engineering Coding Test Version 2

* You must use Erlang, Scala, F#, Haskell, or Lisp. If 

you don’t know any of these languages, that’s OK; part 

of the exercise is for us to see how you pick up new 

languages.

* Please don’t Google the solution. We can’t know for 

sure that you didn’t, but you will . 

* Please show code that compiles and write tests that 

test your work.

* Suggest optimizations if you have ideas for how to 

make the solution faster.

* See learnxinyminutes.com/docs/erlang/ and 

learnxinyminutes.com/docs/scala/ for brief overviews 

of the languages

The cube, 41063625 (345^3), can be permuted to produce 

two other cubes: 56623104 (384^3) and 66430125 

(405^3). In fact, 41063625 is the smallest cube which 

has exactly three permutations of its digits which are 

also cube.

Find the smallest cube for which exactly five 

permutations of its digits are cube.
